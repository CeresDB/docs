# Cluster Deployment

In the [Quick Start](../quick_start.md) section, we have introduced the deployment of single CeresDB instance.

Besides, as a distributed timeseries database, multiple CeresDB instances can be deployed as a cluster to serve with high availability and scalability.

Currently, CeresDB supports two cluster deployment modes:

- [NoMeta Mode](no_meta.md)
- [WithMeta Mode](with_meta.md)
