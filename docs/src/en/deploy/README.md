# Deployment

CeresDB is a distributed timeseries database, that is to say, multiple CeresDB instances can be deployed as a cluster to serve with high availability and scalability.

For now, CeresDB supports two deployment forms:

- Static, rule-based routing mode, see [here](static_routing.md)
- Dynamic routing mode with ceresmeta, see [here](dynamic_routing.md)
