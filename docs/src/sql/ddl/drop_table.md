# CREATE TABLE

## Basic syntax

Basic syntax (parts between `[]` are optional):
```sql
DROP TABLE [IF EXIST] table_name
```

`Drop Table` removes a specific table. This statement should be used with caution, because it removes both the table definition and table data, and this removal is not recoverable.
